`COPY` to a relative destination without `WORKDIR` set.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Severity | Warning |
| Category | Best Practice |
| Default | Enabled |

## Description

While copying to a relative path is not problematic per se, errors happen when changes are introduced to the `WORKDIR` without updating the
destination of the `COPY` command. It is assumed that when a `WORKDIR` is set, the programmer will make sure it works well together with the `COPY`
destinations.

## Examples

### Problematic code

```dockerfile
FROM scratch
COPY foo bar
```

### Correct code

```dockerfile
FROM scratch
COPY foo /bar
```

or:

```dockerfile
FROM scratch
WORKDIR /
COPY foo bar
```
