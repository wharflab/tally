# hadolint/DL3006

Always tag the version of an image explicitly.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Severity | Warning |
| Category | Best Practice |
| Default | Enabled |

## Description

You can never rely that the `latest` tag is a specific version. Always tag the version of an image explicitly to ensure reproducible builds.

## Examples

### Problematic code

```dockerfile
FROM debian
```

### Correct code

```dockerfile
FROM debian:jessie
```

### Exception

When the image name refers to a previously defined alias, tagging is not required:

```dockerfile
FROM debian:jessie as build
RUN build_script

FROM build as tests
RUN test_script

FROM debian:jessie
COPY --from=build foo .
```
