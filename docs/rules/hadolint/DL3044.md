Do not refer to an undefined variable.

> **Superseded by [`buildkit/UndefinedVar`](../buildkit/UndefinedVar.md)**, which provides the same check with typo detection.

## Description

Ensures that environment variables and build arguments are declared before being used. Undeclared variables can lead to unexpected behavior or build
errors.

## Examples

### Problematic code

```dockerfile
FROM alpine
COPY $foo .
```

### Correct code

```dockerfile
FROM alpine
ARG foo
COPY $foo .
```
