Use absolute WORKDIR.

> **Superseded by [`buildkit/WorkdirRelativePath`](../buildkit/WorkdirRelativePath.md)**, which provides the same check with improved diagnostics.

## Description

Using a relative `WORKDIR` without first setting an absolute path can lead to unexpected results if the base image changes its working directory.

## Examples

### Problematic code

```dockerfile
FROM nginx
WORKDIR usr/share/nginx/html
```

### Correct code

```dockerfile
FROM nginx
WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html
```
