# hadolint/DL3007

Using latest is prone to errors if the image will ever update. Pin the version explicitly to a release tag.

| Default | Enabled |

## Description

You can never rely that the `latest` tag is a specific version. Pin the version explicitly to a release tag to ensure reproducible builds.

## Examples

### Problematic code

```dockerfile
FROM debian:latest
```

### Correct code

```dockerfile
FROM debian:jessie
```
