Duplicate stage names are not allowed.

> **Superseded by [`buildkit/DuplicateStageName`](../buildkit/DuplicateStageName.md)**, which provides the same check.

## Description

Defining multiple stages with the same name results in an error because the builder is unable to uniquely resolve the stage name reference.

## Examples

### Problematic code

```dockerfile
FROM debian:latest AS builder
RUN apt-get update

FROM golang:latest AS builder
```

### Correct code

```dockerfile
FROM debian:latest AS deb-builder
RUN apt-get update

FROM golang:latest AS go-builder
```
