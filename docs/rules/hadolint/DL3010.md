## Description

Although `ADD` and `COPY` are functionally similar, generally speaking, `COPY` is preferred. `COPY` only supports the basic copying of local files
into the container, while `ADD` has some features (like local-only tar extraction and remote URL support). The best use for `ADD` is local tar file
auto-extraction into the image.
