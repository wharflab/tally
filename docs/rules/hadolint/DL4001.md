Either use Wget or Curl but not both.

| Default | Enabled |

## Description

Don't install two tools that have the same effect. Using both `wget` and `curl` in a Dockerfile adds unnecessary cruft to the image. Pick one and use
it consistently.

## Examples

### Problematic code

```dockerfile
FROM debian
RUN wget http://google.com
RUN curl http://bing.com
```

### Correct code

```dockerfile
FROM debian
RUN curl http://google.com
RUN curl http://bing.com
```
