# hadolint/DL3012

Provide an exact tag for multiple `HEALTHCHECK` instructions.

> **Superseded by
> [`buildkit/MultipleInstructionsDisallowed`](../buildkit/MultipleInstructionsDisallowed.md)**,
> which covers duplicate `HEALTHCHECK`, `CMD`, and `ENTRYPOINT`
> instructions with auto-fix support.

## Description

Multiple `HEALTHCHECK` instructions should not be used in the same stage because only the last one will be used.
