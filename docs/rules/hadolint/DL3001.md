Command does not make sense in a container.

| Default | Enabled |

## Description

For some POSIX commands it makes no sense to run them in a Docker container because they are bound to the host or are otherwise dangerous (like
`shutdown`, `service`, `ps`, `free`, `top`, `kill`, `mount`, `ifconfig`). Interactive utilities also don't make much sense (`nano`, `vim`).

## Examples

### Problematic code

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
RUN top
```

### Correct code

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
```
