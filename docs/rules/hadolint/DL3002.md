Last user should not be root.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Severity | Warning |
| Category | Security |
| Default | Enabled |

## Description

Switching to the root `USER` opens up certain security risks if an attacker gets access to the container. In order to mitigate this, switch back to a
non-privileged user after running the commands you need as root.

## Examples

### Problematic code

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
USER root
RUN ...
```

### Correct code

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
USER root
RUN ...
USER guest
```
